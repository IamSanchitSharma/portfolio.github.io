                            <p>
                              Myikliniq is a GTA based consumer gadget repairing and retail company founded in 2010. Over the years the company has evolved from one small store to multiple franchises across PEEL and Toronto region. I joined the team in year 2020 being incharge of the online operations, social media marketing, and assistant manager at one store. Our team made it possible to conduct business during the lockdowns by taking online repair orders and providing contactless delivery options which was possible because of the website we built in just two weeks using Agile fundamentals. Now we working to improve the site by providing shopping features for our customers.
